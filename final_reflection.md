# Final Reflection

Looking back on this course, I’m proud of the progress I made as both a student and a programmer. At the beginning of the term, recursion and data structures like linked lists and hash tables felt intimidating. But by the end, I found myself writing and understanding recursive algorithms, managing object design thoughtfully, and improving my debugging workflow. This course wasn’t just about completing assignments, it was about becoming more confident and independent in how I approach programming problems.

## Attendance & Punctuality
I was consistently present in class and missed fewer than five sessions. I made an effort to show up on time and stay fully engaged. This consistency helped me keep up with each week's expectations and stay connected to the course rhythm.

## Participation & Engagement
I actively participated during class when I was called upon to answer a questions. I also took initiative in trying optional problems and reviewing posted solutions deeply, especially for assignments like the hash table and merge sort.

## Presence & Focus
I was mentally present and minimized distractions during class. I didn't make use of available help — whether asking questions during lecture, reading example code, or reaching out for clarification when needed but that's due to the fact that I had a large understanding of the class due to it being my second time taking it. 

## Assignment Timeliness
Most of my work was submitted on time, though there were a couple of assignments I could have started earlier, but I did miss an assignment. I learned the value of working in stages, rather than trying to finish everything in one sitting. I’m continuing to improve my time management by planning out work more strategically.

## Reflection & Growth
I took reflections seriously and compared my code with Leo’s solutions carefully. I learned that code quality isn’t just about passing tests,  it’s about clarity, reusability, and intention. I’ve started writing cleaner methods, removing magic values, and using helper functions as needed.

## Code Quality
I believe my code improved significantly over the semester. I followed the Programmer’s Pact, avoided shortcuts like `break` or `continue`, and wrote code that compiled cleanly and passed the provided tests. I also commented my code thoughtfully and formatted it in a way that fit my understanding. 

## Final Thoughts
This course helped me overcome my hesitation with recursion and reinforced my ability to read and understand complex code. One moment I’m especially proud of was successfully debugging my own recursive `reverseArray` implementation without any outside help, a task that would have overwhelmed me earlier in the term.

**Based on the above, I propose B as my final grade.**
